# Cigarettes and Contractions

Many factors influence the outcome of a pregnancy and the baby’s birth weight. This project focuses on the relationship between gestation time and birth weight and then whether smoking affects the gestation time and the birth weight using data about 1,236 male’s birth weight, and gestational period collected as part of the Child Health and Development Studies in 1961 and 1962.
Information about the baby’s parents — age, education, height, weight, and whether the mother smoked is also recorded. The original dataset has 22 variables, but the project will focus on three variables :

- The length of gestation in days;
- The birth weight in ounces;
- Whether the mother smoked or not.
